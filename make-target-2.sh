# Do warm init stuff, e.g. building and loading CLOS, and stuff which
# can't be done until CLOS is running.
#
# Note that it's normal for the newborn system to think rather hard at
# the beginning of this process (e.g. using nearly 100Mb of virtual memory
# and >30 seconds of CPU time on a 450MHz CPU), and unless you built the
# system with the :SB-SHOW feature enabled, it does it rather silently,
# without trying to tell you about what it's doing. So unless it hangs
# for much longer than that, don't worry, it's likely to be normal.
