# (We don't remove all the directories themselves for a stupid technical
# reason: "gmake clean" in the src/runtime directory gets unhappy if the
# output/ directory doesn't exist, because it tries to build Depends
# before it cleans itself, and src/c-runtime/sbcl.h is a symlink into
# the output/ directory, and it gets the gcc dependency processing gets
# all confused trying to figure out a header file which is a symlink
# into a directory which doesn't exist. We'd like to be able to run
# this script (including "gmake clean" in the src/runtime directory)
# several times in a row without failure.. so we leave the output/
# directory in place.)

# Within all directories, remove things which don't look like source
# files. Some explanations:
#   (symlinks)
#     are never in the sources, so must've been created
#   sbcl
#     the runtime environment, created by compiling C code
#   sbcl.h 
#     information about Lisp code needed to build the runtime environment,
#     created by running GENESIS
#   Config, target
#     architecture-dependent or OS-dependent symlinks
#   *.htm, *.html
#     probably machine-generated translation of DocBook (*.sgml) files
#   core
#     probably a Unix core dump -- not part of the sources anyway
#   *.o, *.lib, *.nm
#     results of C-style linking, assembling, etc.
#   *.core, *.map
#     looks like SBCL SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE or GENESIS output, and
#     certainly not source
#   *~, #*#
#     common names for editor temporary files
#   TAGS, tags
#     files created by GNU etags and ctags
#   .#*, *.orig, .*.orig
#     rubbish left behind by CVS updates
#   *.htm, *.html
#     The system doc sources are SGML, any HTML is
#     automatically-generated output.
#   depend
#     made by "make depend" (or "gmake depend" or some such thing)
#   *.lisp-obj, *.fasl, *.x86f, *.axpf, *.lbytef, *.lib
#     typical extensions for fasl files (not just from SBCL, but
#     from other Lisp systems which might be used as xc hosts)
