;;;; various tests of EVAL with side effects

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; While most of SBCL is derived from the CMU CL system, the test
;;;; files (like this one) were written from scratch after the fork
;;;; from CMU CL.
;;;; 
;;;; This software is in the public domain and is provided with
;;;; absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS files for
;;;; more information.

;;;; Note: this stuff gets loaded in (by LOAD) and is therefore
;;;; evaluated by EVAL, rather than compiled and then loaded; this is
;;;; why this idiom (a sequence of top-level forms) works as a test of
;;;; EVAL.

;;; Until sbcl-0.7.9.x, EVAL was not correctly treating LOCALLY,
;;; MACROLET and SYMBOL-MACROLET, which should preserve top-levelness
;;; of their body forms:

;;; LOCALLY
(locally (defstruct locally-struct a (b t)))

(let ((x (make-locally-struct :a 1)))
  (assert (eql (locally-struct-a x) 1))
  (assert (eql (locally-struct-b x) t)))

(locally
  (defmacro locally-macro (x) `(+ ,x 1))
  (assert (= (locally-macro 3) 4)))

(locally (declare (special x))
  (defun locally-special-test ()
    x)
  (defun locally-special-test-aux ()
    (let ((x 1))
      (declare (special x))
      (locally-special-test)))
  (assert (= (locally-special-test-aux) 1)))

;;; MACROLET
(macrolet ()
  (defstruct macrolet-struct a (b t)))

(let ((x (make-macrolet-struct :a 1)))
  (assert (eql (macrolet-struct-a x) 1))
  (assert (eql (macrolet-struct-b x) t)))

  (assert (= (macrolet-special-test-aux) 1)))
