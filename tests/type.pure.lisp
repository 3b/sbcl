;;; This test is motivated by bug #195, which previously had (THE REAL
;;; #(1 2 3)) give an error which prints as "This is not a (OR
;;; SINGLE-FLOAT DOUBLE-FLOAT RATIONAL)".  We ideally want all of the
;;; defined-by-ANSI types to unparse as themselves or at least
;;; something similar (e.g. CHARACTER can unparse to BASE-CHAR, since
;;; the types are equivalent in current SBCL, and EXTENDED-CHAR can
;;; unparse to NIL, since there are no EXTENDED-CHARs currently).
