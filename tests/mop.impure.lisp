;;;; miscellaneous side-effectful tests of the MOP

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; While most of SBCL is derived from the CMU CL system, the test
;;;; files (like this one) were written from scratch after the fork
;;;; from CMU CL.
;;;; 
;;;; This software is in the public domain and is provided with
;;;; absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS files for
;;;; more information.

;;;; Note that the MOP is not in a supported state. Package issues
;;;; (both MOP/SB-PCL and CL/SB-PCL) have yet to be resolved, and
;;;; there is likely to be missing functionality.  However, this seems
;;;; a good a way as any of ensuring that we have no regressions.
