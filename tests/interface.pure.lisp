;;; Check for fbound external symbols in public packages that have no
;;; argument list information. (This used to be possible when we got
;;; carried away with byte compilation, since the byte compiler can't
;;; record argument list information. Now that there's no byte
;;; compiler, that can't happen, but it still shouldn't hurt to check
;;; in case the argument information goes astray some other way.)
