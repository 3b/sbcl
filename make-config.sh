# cross-compile the system or if you're doing some kind of
# troubleshooting.

# FIXME: Things like :c-stack-grows-..., etc, should be
# *derived-target-features* or equivalent, so that there was a nicer
# way to specify them then sprinkling them in this file. They should
# still be tweakable by advanced users, though, but probably not
# appear in *features* of target. #!+/- should be adjusted to take
# them in account as well. At minimum the nicer specification stuff,
# though:

# collector (indicated by the presence of :GENCGC in *FEATURES*) and
# alpha, sparc and ppc with the stop'n'copy collector (indicated by
# the absence of :GENCGC in *FEATURES*). This isn't a great
# separation, but for now, rather than have :GENCGC in
# base-target-features.lisp-expr, we add it into local-target-features
# if we're building for x86. -- CSR, 2002-02-21 Then we do something
