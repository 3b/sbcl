;;; For the avoidance of doubt, the exported interface is the proposed

;;; If you steal the code from this file to cut and paste into your

;;; Your teeth.  If need be, we'll kick them for you.  This is a
;;; contrib, we're allowed to look in internals.  You're an
;;; application programmer, and are not.

;;; TODO
;;; 1) structs don't have within-file location info.  problem for the
;;;   structure itself, accessors and the predicate
;;; 2) what should find-definition-source on a symbol return?  there may be
;;;   several definitions (class, function, etc)
;;; 3) error handling.  Signal random errors, or handle and resignal 'our'
;;;   error, or return NIL?
;;; 4) FIXMEs
;;; 5) would be nice to have some interface to the compiler that lets us
;;;   fake the filename and position, for use with C-M-x
