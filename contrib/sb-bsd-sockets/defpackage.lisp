A thinly-disguised BSD socket API for SBCL.  Ideas stolen from the BSD
socket API for C and Graham Barr's IO::Socket classes for Perl.

We represent sockets as CLOS objects, and rename a lot of methods and
arguments to fit Lisp style more closely.

<h2>General concepts</h2>

<p>Most of the functions are modelled on the BSD socket API.  BSD sockets
are widely supported, portably <i>("portable" by Unix standards, at least)</i>
available on a variety of systems, and documented.  There are some
differences in approach where we have taken advantage of some of the more useful features of Common Lisp - briefly

<ul>
<li> Where the C API would typically return -1 and set errno, we
signal an error.  All the errors are subclasses of SOCKET-CONDITION
and generally correspond one for one with possible <tt>errno</tt> values

<li> We use multiple return values in many places where the C API would use
pass-by-reference values

<li> We can often avoid supplying an explicit <i>length</i> argument to
functions because we already know how long the argument is.

<li> IP addresses and ports are represented in slightly friendlier fashion
than "network-endian integers".  See the section on <a href="#internet"
>Internet domain</a> sockets for details.
</ul>
