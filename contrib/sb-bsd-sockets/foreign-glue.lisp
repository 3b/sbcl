;;;; Foreign function glue.  This is the only file in the distribution
;;;; that's _intended_ to be vendor-specific.  The macros defined here
;;;; are called from constants.lisp, which was generated from constants.ccon
;;;; by the C compiler as driven by that wacky def-to-lisp thing.

;;;; of course, the whole thing is vendor-specific actually, due to
;;;; the way we use cmucl alien types in constants.ccon as a cheap way
;;;; of transforming C-world alues into Lisp-world values.  But if
;;;; anyone were to port that bit to their preferred implementation, they
;;;; wouldn't need to port all the rest of the cmucl alien interface at
;;;; the same time
