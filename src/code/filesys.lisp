;;;; Unix pathname host support

;;; FIXME: the below shouldn't really be here, but in documentation
;;; (chapter 19 makes a lot of requirements for documenting
;;; implementation-dependent decisions), but anyway it's probably not
;;; what we currently do.
;;;
;;; Unix namestrings have the following format:
;;;
;;; namestring := [ directory ] [ file [ type [ version ]]]
;;; directory := [ "/" ] { file "/" }*
;;; file := [^/]*
;;; type := "." [^/.]*
;;; version := "." ([0-9]+ | "*")
;;;
;;; Note: this grammar is ambiguous. The string foo.bar.5 can be
;;; parsed as either just the file specified or as specifying the
;;; file, type, and version. Therefore, we use the following rules
;;; when confronted with an ambiguous file.type.version string:
;;;
;;; - If the first character is a dot, it's part of the file. It is not
;;; considered a dot in the following rules.
;;;
;;; - Otherwise, the last dot separates the file and the type.
;;;
;;; Wildcard characters:
;;;
;;; If the directory, file, type components contain any of the
;;; following characters, it is considered part of a wildcard pattern
;;; and has the following meaning.
;;;
;;; ? - matches any one character
;;; * - matches any zero or more characters.
;;; [abc] - matches any of a, b, or c.
;;; {str1,str2,...,strn} - matches any of str1, str2, ..., or strn.
;;;   (FIXME: no it doesn't)
;;;
;;; Any of these special characters can be preceded by a backslash to
;;; cause it to be treated as a regular character.

;;;; DIRECTORY

(/show0 "filesys.lisp 800")

;;; NOTE: There is a fair amount of hair below that is probably not
;;; strictly necessary.
;;;
;;; The issue is the following: what does (DIRECTORY "SYS:*;") mean?
;;; Until 2004-01, SBCL's behaviour was unquestionably wrong, as it
;;; did not translate the logical pathname at all, but instead treated
;;; it as a physical one.  Other Lisps seem to to treat this call as
;;; equivalent to (DIRECTORY (TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME "SYS:*;")),
;;; which is fine as far as it goes, but not very interesting, and
;;; arguably counterintuitive.  (PATHNAME-MATCH-P "SYS:SRC;" "SYS:*;")
;;; is true, so why should "SYS:SRC;" not show up in the call to
;;; DIRECTORY?  (assuming the physical pathname corresponding to it
;;; exists, of course).
;;;
;;; So, the interpretation that I am pushing is for all pathnames
;;; matching the input pathname to be queried.  This means that we
;;; need to compute the intersection of the input pathname and the
;;; logical host FROM translations, and then translate the resulting
;;; pathname using the host to the TO translation; this treatment is
;;; recursively invoked until we get a physical pathname, whereupon
;;; our physical DIRECTORY implementation takes over.

;;; FIXME: this is an incomplete implementation.  It only works when
;;; both are logical pathnames (which is OK, because that's the only
;;; case when we call it), but there are other pitfalls as well: see
;;; the DIRECTORY-HELPER below for some, but others include a lack of
;;; pattern handling.
