;;; FIXME: *GC-TRIGGER* seems to be denominated in bytes, not words.
;;; And limiting it to INDEX is fairly reasonable in order to avoid

;;; for thought about weird gotchas of the GC-control mechanism itself
;;; consing as it operates. But as of sbcl-0.7.5, 512Mbytes of memory
;;; costs $54.95 at Fry's in Dallas but cheap consumer 64-bit machines
;;; are still over the horizon, so gratuitously limiting our heap size
;;; to FIXNUM bytes seems fairly stupid. It'd be reasonable to
;;; (1) allow arbitrary UNSIGNED-BYTE values of *GC-TRIGGER*, or
;;; (2) redenominate this variable in words instead of bytes, postponing
;;;     the problem to heaps which exceed 50% of the machine's address
;;;     space, or even
;;; (3) redemoninate this variable in CONS-sized two-word units,
;;;     allowing it to cover the entire memory space at the price of
;;;     possible loss of clarity.
;;; (And whatever is done, it'd also be good to rename the variable so
