;;;; ASSERT and CHECK-TYPE

;;; ASSERT is written this way, to call ASSERT-ERROR, because of how
;;; closures are compiled. RESTART-CASE has forms with closures that
;;; the compiler causes to be generated at the top of any function
;;; using RESTART-CASE, regardless of whether they are needed. Thus if
;;; we just wrapped a RESTART-CASE around the call to ERROR, we'd have
;;; to do a significant amount of work at runtime allocating and
;;; deallocating the closures regardless of whether they were ever
;;; needed.
;;;
;;; ASSERT-ERROR isn't defined until a later file because it uses the
;;; macro RESTART-CASE, which isn't defined until a later file.
