;;;
;;; TYPE-UNION (and the OR type) doesn't properly canonicalize an
;;; exhaustive partition or coalesce contiguous ranges of numeric
;;; types.
;;;
;;; There are all sorts of nasty problems with open bounds on FLOAT
;;; types (and probably FLOAT types in general.)
;;;
;;; RATIO and BIGNUM are not recognized as numeric types.

;;; FIXME: This really should go away. Alas, it doesn't seem to be so
;;; simple to make it go away.. (See bug 123 in BUGS file.)
