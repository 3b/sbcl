;;; HOW THE STREAM STRUCTURE IS USED:
;;;
;;; Many of the slots of the stream structure contain functions
;;; which are called to perform some operation on the stream. Closed
;;; streams have #'CLOSED-FLAME in all of their function slots. If
;;; one side of an I/O or echo stream is closed, the whole stream is
;;; considered closed. The functions in the operation slots take
;;; arguments as follows:
;;;
;;; In:			Stream, Eof-Errorp, Eof-Value
;;; Bin:		Stream, Eof-Errorp, Eof-Value
;;; N-Bin:		Stream, Buffer, Start, Numbytes, Eof-Errorp
;;; Out:		Stream, Character
;;; Bout:		Stream, Integer
;;; Sout:		Stream, String, Start, End
;;; Misc:		Stream, Operation, &Optional Arg1, Arg2
;;;
;;; In order to save space, some of the less common stream operations
;;; are handled by just one function, the MISC method. This function
;;; is passed a keyword which indicates the operation to perform.
;;; The following keywords are used:
;;;  :listen 		- Return the following values:
;;; 			     t if any input waiting.
;;; 			     :eof if at eof.
;;; 			     nil if no input is available and not at eof.
;;;  :unread		- Unread the character Arg.
;;;  :close		- Do any stream specific stuff to close the stream.
;;;			  The methods are set to closed-flame by the close
;;;			  function, so that need not be done by this
;;;			  function.
;;;  :clear-input 	- Clear any unread input
;;;  :finish-output,
;;;  :force-output	- Cause output to happen
;;;  :clear-output	- Clear any undone output
;;;  :element-type 	- Return the type of element the stream deals with.
;;;  :line-length	- Return the length of a line of output.
;;;  :charpos		- Return current output position on the line.
;;;  :file-length	- Return the file length of a file stream.
;;;  :file-position	- Return or change the current position of a
;;;                       file stream.
;;;  :file-name		- Return the name of an associated file.
;;;  :interactive-p     - Is this an interactive device?
;;;
;;; In order to do almost anything useful, it is necessary to
;;; define a new type of structure that includes stream, so that the
;;; stream can have some state information.
;;;
;;; THE STREAM IN-BUFFER:
;;;
;;; The IN-BUFFER in the stream holds characters or bytes that
;;; are ready to be read by some input function. If there is any
;;; stuff in the IN-BUFFER, then the reading function can use it
;;; without calling any stream method. Any stream may put stuff in
;;; the IN-BUFFER, and may also assume that any input in the IN-BUFFER
;;; has been consumed before any in-method is called. If a text
;;; stream has in IN-BUFFER, then the first character should not be
;;; used to buffer normal input so that it is free for unreading into.
;;;
;;; The IN-BUFFER slot is a vector +IN-BUFFER-LENGTH+ long. The
;;; IN-INDEX is the index in the IN-BUFFER of the first available
;;; object. The available objects are thus between IN-INDEX and the
;;; length of the IN-BUFFER.
;;;
;;; When this buffer is only accessed by the normal stream
;;; functions, the number of function calls is halved, thus
;;; potentially doubling the speed of simple operations. If the
;;; FAST-READ-CHAR and FAST-READ-BYTE macros are used, nearly all
;;; function call overhead is removed, vastly speeding up these
;;; important operations.
;;;
;;; If a stream does not have an IN-BUFFER, then the IN-BUFFER slot
;;; must be nil, and the IN-INDEX must be +IN-BUFFER-LENGTH+. These are
;;; the default values for the slots.
