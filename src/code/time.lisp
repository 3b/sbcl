;;;; Encode and decode universal times.

;;; In August 2003, work was done in this file for more plausible
;;; timezone handling after the unix timezone database runs out in
;;; 2038.  We assume that timezone rules are trending sane rather than
;;; insane, so for all years after the end of time_t we apply the
;;; rules for 2035/2036 instead of the actual date asked for.  Making
;;; the same assumption about the early 1900s would be less
;;; reasonable, however, so please note that we're still broken for
;;; local time between 1900-1-1 and 1901-12-13

;;; It should be noted that 64 bit machines don't actually fix this
;;; problem, at least as of 2003, because the Unix zonefiles are
;;; specified in terms of 32 bit fields even on, say, the Alpha.  So,
;;; references to the range of time_t elsewhere in this file should
;;; rightly be read as shorthand for the range of an signed 32 bit
;;; number of seconds since 1970-01-01

;;; I'm obliged to Erik Naggum's "Long, Painful History of Time" paper
;;; <http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~enag/lugm-time.html> for the choice of epoch
;;; here.  By starting the year in March, we avoid having to test the month
;;; whenever deciding whether to account for a leap day.  2000 is especially
;;; special, because it's disvisible by 400, hence the start of a 400 year
;;; leap year cycle

;;; If a universal-time is after time_t runs out, we find its offset
;;; from 1st March of whichever year it falls in, then add that to
;;; 2035-3-1.  This date has two relevant properties: (1) somewhere
;;; near the end of time_t, and (2) preceding a leap year.  Thus a
;;; date which is e.g. 365.5 days from March 1st in its year will be
;;; treated for timezone lookup as if it were Feb 29th 2036

;;; This epoch is used only for fixing the timezones-outside-time_t
;;; problem.  Someday it would be nice to come back to this code and
;;; see if the rest of the file and its references to Spice Lisp
;;; history (Perq time base?) could be cleaned up any on this basis.
;;; -- dan, 2003-08-08


;;; Subtract from the returned Internal-Time to get the universal
;;; time. The offset between our time base and the Perq one is 2145
