;;;; various constants and essentially-constants

;;; a string which appears at the start of a fasl file header
;;;
;;; This value is used to identify fasl files. Even though this is not
;;; declared as a constant (because ANSI Common Lisp has no facility
;;; for declaring values which are constant under EQUAL but not EQL),
;;; obviously you shouldn't mess with it lightly. If you do set a new
;;; value for some reason, keep these things in mind:
;;; * To avoid confusion with the similar but incompatible CMU CL
;;;   fasl file format, the value should not be "FASL FILE", which
;;;   is what CMU CL used for the same purpose.
;;; * Since its presence at the head of a file is used by LOAD to
;;;   decide whether a file is to be fasloaded or just loaded
;;;   ordinarily (as source), the value should be something which
;;;   can't legally appear at the head of a Lisp source file.
;;; * The value should not contain any line-terminating characters,
;;;   because they're hard to express portably and because the LOAD
;;;   code might reasonably use READ-LINE to get the value to compare
;;;   against.

;;; the code for a character which terminates a fasl file header
(defconstant +fasl-header-string-stop-char-code+ 255)

;;; This value should be incremented when the system changes in such
;;; a way that it will no longer work reliably with old fasl files.

;;; 2 = sbcl-0.6.4 uses COMPILE-OR-LOAD-DEFGENERIC.
;;; 3 = sbcl-0.6.6 uses private symbol, not :EMPTY, for empty HASH-TABLE slot.
;;; 4 = sbcl-0.6.7 uses HAIRY-DATA-VECTOR-REF and HAIRY-DATA-VECTOR-SET
;;;     when array headers or data element type uncertainty exist, and
;;;     uses DATA-VECTOR-REF and DATA-VECTOR-SET only for VOPs. (Thus,
;;;     full calls to DATA-VECTOR-REF and DATA-VECTOR-SET from older
;;;     fasl files would fail, because there are no DEFUNs for these
;;;     operations any more.)
;;; 5 = sbcl-0.6.8 has rearranged static symbols.
;;; 6 = sbcl-0.6.9, got rid of non-ANSI %DEFCONSTANT/%%DEFCONSTANT stuff
;;;     and deleted a slot from DEBUG-SOURCE structure.
;;; 7 = around sbcl-0.6.9.8, merged SB-CONDITIONS package into SB-KERNEL
;;; 8 = sbcl-0.6.10.4 revived Gray stream support, changing stream layouts.
;;; 9 = deleted obsolete CONS-UNIQUE-TAG bytecode in sbcl-0.6.11.8
;;; (somewhere in here also changes to AND and OR CTYPE layouts) 
;;; 10 = new layout for CONDITION in sbcl-0.6.11.38
;;; 11 = (a) new helper functions for MAKE-LOAD-FORM (HASH-TABLE) in
;;;          sbcl-0.6.12.11
;;;      (b) new address space constants for OpenBSD in 0.6.12.17
;;;          (doesn't need separate version from (a) because the
;;;          OpenBSD port was broken from sometime before 0.6.12.11
;;;          until the address space was changed)
;;; 12 = sbcl-0.6.12.22 added new SB-FASL package
;;; 13 = sbcl-0.6.12.28 removed some elements from *STATIC-SYMBOLS* 
;;; 14 = sbcl-0.6.12.29 removed more elements from *STATIC-SYMBOLS* 
;;; 15 = sbcl-0.6.12.33 changed the layout of STREAM
;;; 16 = sbcl-0.pre7.15 changed the layout of PRETTY-STREAM
;;; 17 = sbcl-0.pre7.38 (merging many changes accumulated in
;;;      the sbcl-0.pre7.37.flaky5.* branch back into the main branch)
;;;      got rid of byte compiler, byte interpreter, and IR1
;;;      interpreter, changed %DEFUN and DEFSTRUCT, changed the
;;;      meaning of FOP-FSET, and changed the layouts of various
;;;      internal compiler structures (e.g. DEFSTRUCT CLAMBDA)
