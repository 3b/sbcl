;;;; various constants and essentially-constants

;;; a string which appears at the start of a fasl file header
;;;
;;; This value is used to identify fasl files. Even though this is not
;;; declared as a constant (because ANSI Common Lisp has no facility
;;; for declaring values which are constant under EQUAL but not EQL),
;;; obviously you shouldn't mess with it lightly. If you do set a new
;;; value for some reason, keep these things in mind:
;;; * To avoid confusion with the similar but incompatible CMU CL
;;;   fasl file format, the value should not be "FASL FILE", which
;;;   is what CMU CL used for the same purpose.
;;; * Since its presence at the head of a file is used by LOAD to
;;;   decide whether a file is to be fasloaded or just loaded
;;;   ordinarily (as source), the value should be something which
;;;   can't legally appear at the head of a Lisp source file.
;;; * The value should not contain any line-terminating characters,
;;;   because they're hard to express portably and because the LOAD
;;;   code might reasonably use READ-LINE to get the value to compare
;;;   against.

(def!constant +fasl-file-version+ 65)
;;; (record of versions before 2003 deleted in 2003-04-26/0.pre8.107 or so)
;;; 38: (2003-01-05) changed names of internal SORT machinery
;;; 39: (2003-02-20) in 0.7.12.1 a slot was added to
;;;     DEFSTRUCT-SLOT-DESCRIPTION
;;; 40: (2003-03-11) changed value of (SXHASH NIL)
;;; 41: (2003-04-26) enforced binary incompatibility between +SB-THREAD
;;;     and -SB-THREAD builds
;;; 42: (2003-05-22) %NAME slot changed to NAME in
;;;     DEFSTRUCT-SLOT-DESCRIPTION
;;; 43: (2003-07-18) Something could easily have changed incompatibly in
;;;     recent maintenance, e.g. from (VECTOR NIL)-as-string support.
;;;     (And experimental results suggest that compatibility was broken
;;;     between about 0.8.1.29 and 0.8.1.39.)
;;; 44: (2003-08-25) various changes leading up to 0.8.3
;;;     <dan`b> what happened this month to stalate the fasls?
;;;     <Krystof_> I think I renumbered everything again
;;;     <Krystof_> simple-array-unsigned-byte-7, probably
;;;     <Krystof_> (thanks to pfdietz)
;;; 45: (2003-10-02) I (WHN) incremented the version for the 0.8.4
;;;     release because I couldn't immediately convince myself that
;;;     .fasl files could never possibly ever refer to the SB-C
;;;     CONTINUATION-related data types which were changed
;;;     incompatibly in 0.8.3.62.
;;; 46: (2003-11-11) Tim Daly, Jr. (and Christophe Rhodes) reported
;;;     .fasl incompatibility on sbcl-devel 2003-11-09.
;;; 47: (2003-11-30) Static variables were rearranged in 0.8.6.11.
;;; 48: (2004-03-01) Renumbered all the widetags to allow for more
;;;     microefficiency in sbcl-0.8.8.10
;;; 49: (2004-05-04) Changed implementation of DEFFOO macros and the
;;;     functions they expand to.
;;; 50: (2004-05-20) Changed %COMPILER-DEFUN signature again.
;;; 51: (2004-07-24) Package locks (SBCL 0.8.12.7) changed signature of
;;;     %DEFPACKAGE.
;;; 52: (2004-11-02) Merge of SB-UNICODE.
;;; 53: (2005-02-22) Something introduced in SBCL 0.8.19.26 (give or take
;;;     a couple of patches) invalidated some FFI-related fasls. Probably
;;;     caused by "lazy alien resolution improvements".
;;; 54: (2005-03-22) At least "0.8.20.6: Make FILE-STREAM and STRING-STREAM
;;;     potential mixins in CLOS" and "0.8.20.21: Add immediate single-floats
;;;     on x86-64."
;;; 55: (2005-04-06) EXTERN-ALIEN-NAME logic moved from fixups to
;;;     FIND-FOREIGN-SYMBOL-IN-TABLE &co.
;;; 56: (2005-05-22) Something between 0.9.0.1 and 0.9.0.14. My money is
;;;     on 0.9.0.6 (MORE CASE CONSISTENCY).
;;; 57: (2005-06-12) Raw slot rearrangement in 0.9.1.38
;;; 58: (2005-08-16) Multiple incompatible changes between 0.9.3 and 0.9.3.60
;;; 59: (2005-09-18) METAOBJECT implementation, removal of INSTANCE and
;;;     FUNCALLABLE-INSTANCE classes.
;;; 60: (2005-10-24) Bumped for 0.9.6
;;; 61: (2005-11-06) Improved source location recording added extra parameters
;;;     to multiple %DEFMUMBLE functions.
;;; 62: (2005-12-30) Make the count of FASL header counted strings
;;;     a 32-bit value also on 64-bit platforms.
;;; 63: (2006-01-27) Shuffle storage classes around to reduce the error
;;;     trap information size on RISCy platforms.
;;; 64: (2006-03-24) New calling convention for unknown-values on x86 and
;;;     x86-64.  Also (belatedly) PPC/gencgc, including :gencgc on FPAFF.
;;; 65: (2006-04-11) Package locking interface changed.
