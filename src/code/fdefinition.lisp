;;; FIXME: If the fundamental operation performed when
;;; funcalling a symbol is %COERCE-NAME-TO-FUNCTION, which expands into
;;; FDEFINITION-OBJECT, which does (INFO :FUNCTION :DEFINITION NAME),
;;; that's a horrendously heavyweight way to implement SYMBOL-FUNCTION.
;;; What compelling reason is there for all this hairiness? The only
;;; thing I can think of is that it does give a place to store
;;; SETF functions, but I don't think that's a good enough reason.
;;; It might even be that the FDEFINITION arrangement saves a little
;;; space, if the proportion of function-less symbols is high enough,
;;; but I don't think that's a good enough reason, either.
;;; I'd really like to wipe out FDEFN stuff root and branch, and
;;; just store SETF functions in the symbol property list.
;;;
;;; One problem with just doing the simple thing: What happens when
;;; people call symbols which have no function definitions?
;;;   1. Just hit "undefined function" error -- with no clue as to
;;;      what undefined function it was. (This might actually not be
;;;      too horrible, since the compiler warns you about undefined
;;;      functions and the debugger aims, with incomplete success,
;;;      to show you what form caused an error.)
;;;   2. various solutions involving closures in the function slot,
;;;      all of which have the drawback of extra memory use and extra
;;;      difficulty in detecting when functions are undefined
;;;   2a. Have every single symbol have an undefined function closure
;;;       which points back to it to tell you which undefined symbol it
;;;       was. (4 extra words per undefined symbol)
;;;   2b. Play tricks with FDEFINITION, where the default SYMBOL-FUNCTION
;;;       for any function is an anonymous "undefined function" error
;;;       which doesn't tell you what the problem was, but if FDEFINITION
;;;       is ever called on an undefined symbol, it helpfully changes the
;;;       function definition to point to a closure which knows which
;;;       symbol caused the problem.
;;;   4. Just don't sweat it except when DEBUG>SPEED, where the calling
;;;      convention gets tweaked to test for the undefined-function
;;;      function at call time and bail out with helpful information
;;;      if it's there.
;;;   5. Require that the function calling convention be stereotyped
;;;      along the lines of
;;;		mov %ebx, local_immediate_3	    ; Point to symbol.
;;;		mov %eax, symbol_fun_offset(%eax)   ; Point to function.
;;;		call *function_code_pointer(%eax)   ; Go.
;;;      That way, it's guaranteed that on entry to a function, %EBX points
;;;      back to the symbol which was used to indirect into the function,
;;;      so the undefined function handler can base its complaint on that.
;;;
;;; Another problem with doing the simple thing: people will want to
;;; indirect through something in order to get to SETF functions, in
;;; order to be able to redefine them. What will they indirect
;;; through? This could be done with a hack, making an anonymous
;;; symbol and linking it to the main symbol's SB!KERNEL:SETF-FUNCTION
;;; property. The anonymous symbol could even point back to the symbol
;;; it's the SETF function for, so that if the SETF function was
;;; undefined at the time a call was made, the debugger could say
;;; which function caused the problem. It'd probably be cleaner,
;;; though, to use a new type of primitive object (SYMBOLOID?)
;;; instead. It could probably be like symbol except that its name
;;; could be any object and its value points back to the symbol which
;;; owns it. Then the setf functions for FOO could be on the list (GET
;;; FOO 'SB!KERNEL:SYMBOLOIDS)
;;;
;;; FIXME: Oh, my. Now that I've started thinking about it, I
;;; appreciate more fully how weird and twisted FDEFNs might be. Look
;;; at the calling sequence for full calls. It goes and reads the
;;; address of a function object from its own table of immediate
;;; values, then jumps into that. Consider how weird that is. Not only
;;; is it not doing indirection through a symbol (which I'd already
;;; realized) but it's not doing indirection through

;;; The compiler emits calls to this when someone tries to funcall a symbol.

;;;; FDEFINITION

;;; KLUDGE: Er, it looks as though this means that

;;; doesn't do the same thing as

;;; That doesn't look like ANSI behavior to me. Look e.g. at the
;;; ANSI definition of TRACE: "Whenever a traced function is invoked,
;;; information about the call, ..". Try this:
;;;   (DEFUN FOO () (PRINT "foo"))
;;;   (TRACE FOO)

;;; punt all this encapsulation stuff and go back to a simple but
;;; correct implementation of TRACE? We'd lose the ability to redefine
;;; a TRACEd function and keep the trace in place, but that seems
;;; tolerable to me. (Is the wrapper stuff needed for anything else
;;; besides TRACE?)
;;;
;;; The only problem I can see with not having a wrapper: If tracing
;;; EQ, EQL, EQUAL, or EQUALP causes its function address to change,
;;; it will mess up the MAKE-HASH-TABLE logic which uses EQ tests
;;; on those function values. -- WHN 19990906
