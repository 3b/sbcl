;;; been told that is a FreeBSD/Linux-only thing.  Meanwhile, this will
;;; make our filenames a lot less predictable.
;;; (The man file for open() says O_EXCL should treat even a symlink as
;;; an existing file.  I wonder if it really does that.)
;;; Also, no more dependence on ASCII character ordering.
