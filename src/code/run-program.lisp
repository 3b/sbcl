;;;; RUN-PROGRAM and friends, a facility for running Unix programs
;;;; from inside SBCL

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the
;;;; public domain. The software is in the public domain and is
;;;; provided with absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS
;;;; files for more information.

;;;; hacking the Unix environment
;;;;
;;;; In the original CMU CL code that LOAD-FOREIGN is derived from, the
;;;; Unix environment (as in "man environ") was represented as an
;;;; alist from keywords to strings, so that e.g. the Unix environment
;;;;   "SHELL=/bin/bash" "HOME=/root" "PAGER=less"
;;;; was represented as
;;;;   ((:SHELL . "/bin/bash") (:HOME . "/root") (:PAGER "less"))
;;;; This had a few problems in principle: the mapping into
;;;; keyword symbols smashed the case of environment
;;;; variables, and the whole mapping depended on the presence of
;;;; #\= characters in the environment strings. In practice these
;;;; problems weren't hugely important, since conventionally environment
;;;; variables are uppercase strings followed by #\= followed by
;;;; arbitrary data. However, since it's so manifestly not The Right
;;;; Thing to make code which breaks unnecessarily on input which
;;;; doesn't follow what is, after all, only a tradition, we've switched
;;;; formats in SBCL, so that the fundamental environment list
;;;; is just a list of strings, with a one-to-one-correspondence
;;;; to the C-level representation. I.e., in the example above,
;;;; the SBCL representation is
;;;;   '("SHELL=/bin/bash" "HOME=/root" "PAGER=less")
;;;; CMU CL's implementation is currently supported to help with porting.
;;;;
;;;; It's not obvious that this code belongs here (instead of e.g. in
;;;; unix.lisp), since it has only a weak logical connection with
;;;; RUN-PROGRAM. However, physically it's convenient to put it here.
;;;; It's not needed at cold init, so we *can* put it in this
;;;; warm-loaded file. And by putting it in this warm-loaded file, we
;;;; make it easy for it to get to the C-level 'environ' variable.
;;;; which (at least in sbcl-0.6.10 on Red Hat Linux 6.2) is not
;;;; visible at GENESIS time.

  "RUN-PROGRAM creates a new Unix process running the Unix program found in
   the file specified by the PROGRAM argument.  ARGS are the standard
   arguments that can be passed to a Unix program. For no arguments, use NIL
   (which means that just the name of the program is passed as arg 0).

   RUN-PROGRAM will either return NIL or a PROCESS structure.  See the CMU
   Common Lisp Users Manual for details about the PROCESS structure.

   notes about Unix environments (as in the :ENVIRONMENT and :ENV args):
     1. The SBCL implementation of RUN-PROGRAM, like Perl and many other
        programs, but unlike the original CMU CL implementation, copies
        the Unix environment by default.
     2. Running Unix programs from a setuid process, or in any other
        situation where the Unix environment is under the control of someone
        else, is a mother lode of security problems. If you are contemplating
        doing this, read about it first. (The Perl community has a lot of good
        documentation about this and other security issues in script-like
        programs.)

   The &KEY arguments have the following meanings:
     :ENVIRONMENT
        a list of SIMPLE-STRINGs describing the new Unix environment (as
        in \"man environ\"). The default is to copy the environment of
        the current process.
     :ENV
        an alternative lossy representation of the new Unix environment,
        for compatibility with CMU CL
     :WAIT
        If non-NIL (default), wait until the created process finishes.  If
        NIL, continue running Lisp until the program finishes.
     :PTY
        Either T, NIL, or a stream.  Unless NIL, the subprocess is established
	under a PTY.  If :pty is a stream, all output to this pty is sent to
	this stream, otherwise the PROCESS-PTY slot is filled in with a stream
	connected to pty that can read output and write input.
     :INPUT
        Either T, NIL, a pathname, a stream, or :STREAM.  If T, the standard
	input for the current process is inherited.  If NIL, /dev/null
	is used.  If a pathname, the file so specified is used.  If a stream,
	all the input is read from that stream and send to the subprocess.  If
	:STREAM, the PROCESS-INPUT slot is filled in with a stream that sends 
	its output to the process. Defaults to NIL.
     :IF-INPUT-DOES-NOT-EXIST (when :INPUT is the name of a file)
        can be one of:
           :ERROR to generate an error
           :CREATE to create an empty file
           NIL (the default) to return NIL from RUN-PROGRAM
     :OUTPUT 
        Either T, NIL, a pathname, a stream, or :STREAM.  If T, the standard
	output for the current process is inherited.  If NIL, /dev/null
	is used.  If a pathname, the file so specified is used.  If a stream,
	all the output from the process is written to this stream. If
	:STREAM, the PROCESS-OUTPUT slot is filled in with a stream that can
	be read to get the output. Defaults to NIL.
     :IF-OUTPUT-EXISTS (when :OUTPUT is the name of a file)
        can be one of:
           :ERROR (the default) to generate an error
           :SUPERSEDE to supersede the file with output from the program
           :APPEND to append output from the program to the file 
           NIL to return NIL from RUN-PROGRAM, without doing anything
     :ERROR and :IF-ERROR-EXISTS
        Same as :OUTPUT and :IF-OUTPUT-EXISTS, except that :ERROR can also be
	specified as :OUTPUT in which case all error output is routed to the
	same place as normal output.
     :STATUS-HOOK
        This is a function the system calls whenever the status of the
        process changes.  The function takes the process as an argument."
