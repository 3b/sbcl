  ;; (1) This is not FLUSHABLE because it's defined to signal errors.
  ;; (2) It's not worth trying to make this FOLDABLE in the
  ;;     cross-compiler,because
  ;;       (a) it would probably be really hard to make all the 
  ;;           tricky issues (e.g. which specialized array types are
  ;;           supported) match between cross-compiler and target
  ;;           compiler, and besides
  ;;       (b) leaving it not FOLDABLE lets us use the idiom
  ;;	           (COERCE FOO 'SOME-SPECIALIZED-ARRAY-TYPE-OR-ANOTHER)
  ;;	       as a way of delaying the generation of specialized
  ;;	       array types until runtime, which helps us keep the
  ;;	       cross-compiler's dumper relatively simple and which
  ;;	       lets us preserve distinctions which might not even exist
  ;;           on the cross-compilation host (because ANSI doesn't
  ;;	       guarantee that specialized array types exist there).
