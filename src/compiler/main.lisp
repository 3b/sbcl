;;;; When reading from a file, we have to keep track of some source
;;;; information. We also exploit our ability to back up for printing
;;;; the error context and for recovering from errors.
;;;;
;;;; The interface we provide to this stuff is the stream-oid
;;;; Source-Info structure. The bookkeeping is done as a side-effect
;;;; of getting the next source form.

;;; A FILE-INFO structure holds all the source information for a
;;; given file.

   references at compile time. NIL means that global function names

;;;; MAKE-LOAD-FORM stuff

;;; The entry point for MAKE-LOAD-FORM support. When IR1 conversion
;;; finds a constant structure, it invokes this to arrange for proper
;;; dumping. If it turns out that the constant has already been
;;; dumped, then we don't need to do anything.
;;;
;;; If the constant hasn't been dumped, then we check to see whether
;;; we are in the process of creating it. We detect this by
;;; maintaining the special *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED* as a list of all
;;; the constants we are in the process of creating. Actually, each
;;; entry is a list of the constant and any init forms that need to be
;;; processed on behalf of that constant.
;;;
;;; It's not necessarily an error for this to happen. If we are
;;; processing the init form for some object that showed up *after*
;;; the original reference to this constant, then we just need to
;;; defer the processing of that init form. To detect this, we
;;; maintain *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE-LAST-INIT* as a list of the
;;; constants created since the last time we started processing an
;;; init form. If the constant passed to emit-make-load-form shows up
;;; in this list, then there is a circular chain through creation
;;; forms, which is an error.
;;;
;;; If there is some intervening init form, then we blow out of
;;; processing it by throwing to the tag PENDING-INIT. The value we
;;; throw is the entry from *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED*. This is so the
;;; offending init form can be tacked onto the init forms for the
;;; circular object.
;;;
;;; If the constant doesn't show up in *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED*, then
;;; we have to create it. We call MAKE-LOAD-FORM and check to see
;;; whether the creation form is the magic value
;;; :JUST-DUMP-IT-NORMALLY. If it is, then we don't do anything. The
;;; dumper will eventually get its hands on the object and use the
;;; normal structure dumping noise on it.
;;;
;;; Otherwise, we bind *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED* and
;;; *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE- LAST-INIT* and compile the creation form
;;; much the way LOAD-TIME-VALUE does. When this finishes, we tell the
;;; dumper to use that result instead whenever it sees this constant.
;;;
;;; Now we try to compile the init form. We bind
;;; *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE-LAST-INIT* to NIL and compile the init
;;; form (and any init forms that were added because of circularity
;;; detection). If this works, great. If not, we add the init forms to
