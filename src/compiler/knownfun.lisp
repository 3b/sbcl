;;; IR1 boolean function attributes
;;;
;;; There are a number of boolean attributes of known functions which we like
;;; to have in IR1. This information is mostly side effect information of a
;;; sort, but it is different from the kind of information we want in IR2. We
;;; aren't interested in a fine breakdown of side effects, since we do very
;;; little code motion on IR1. We are interested in some deeper semantic
;;; properties such as whether it is safe to pass stack closures to.
(def-boolean-attribute ir1
  ;; May call functions that are passed as arguments. In order to determine
  ;; what other effects are present, we must find the effects of all arguments
  ;; that may be functions.
  call
  ;; May incorporate function or number arguments into the result or somehow
  ;; pass them upward. Note that this applies to any argument that *might* be
  ;; a function or number, not just the arguments that always are.
  unsafe
  ;; May fail to return during correct execution. Errors are O.K.
  unwind
  ;; The (default) worst case. Includes all the other bad things, plus any
  ;; other possible bad thing. If this is present, the above bad attributes
  ;; will be explicitly present as well.
  any
  ;; May be constant-folded. The function has no side effects, but may be
  ;; affected by side effects on the arguments. e.g. SVREF, MAPC. Functions
  ;; that side-effect their arguments are not considered to be foldable.
  ;; Although it would be "legal" to constant fold them (since it "is an error"
  ;; to modify a constant), we choose not to mark these functions as foldable
  ;; in this database.
  foldable
  ;; May be eliminated if value is unused. The function has no side effects
  ;; except possibly CONS. If a function is defined to signal errors, then it
  ;; is not flushable even if it is movable or foldable.
  flushable
  ;; May be moved with impunity. Has no side effects except possibly CONS, and
  ;; is affected only by its arguments.
  movable
  ;; Function is a true predicate likely to be open-coded. Convert any
  ;; non-conditional uses into (IF <pred> T NIL).
  predicate
  ;; Inhibit any warning for compiling a recursive definition. (Normally the
  ;; compiler warns when compiling a recursive definition for a known function,
  ;; since it might be a botched interpreter stub.)
  recursive
  ;; Function does explicit argument type checking, so the declared type should
  ;; not be asserted when a definition is compiled.
