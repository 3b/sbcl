;;;; allocation helpers

;;; Two allocation approaches are implemented. A call into C can be
;;; used, and in that case special care can be taken to disable
;;; interrupts. Alternatively with gencgc inline allocation is possible
;;; although it isn't interrupt safe.

;;; For GENCGC it is possible to inline object allocation, to permit
;;; this set the following variable to True.
;;;
;;; FIXME: The comment above says that this isn't interrupt safe. Is that
;;; right? If so, do we want to do this? And surely we don't want to do this by
;;; default? How much time does it save to do this? Is it any different in the
;;; current CMU CL version instead of the one that I grabbed in 1998?
;;; (Later observation: In order to be interrupt safe, it'd probably
;;; have to use PSEUDO-ATOMIC, so it's probably not -- yuck. Try benchmarks
;;; with and without inline allocation, and unless the inline allocation
;;; wins by a whole lot, it's not likely to be worth messing with. If
;;; we want to hack up memory allocation for performance, effort spent
;;; on DYNAMIC-EXTENT would probably give a better payoff.)
(defvar *maybe-use-inline-allocation* t)

;;; Emit code to allocate an object with a size in bytes given by
;;; Size. The size may be an integer of a TN. If Inline is a VOP
;;; node-var then it is used to make an appropriate speed vs size
;;; decision.
;;;
;;; FIXME: We call into C.. except when inline allocation is enabled..?
;;;
;;; FIXME: Also, calls to
;;; ALLOCATION are always wrapped with PSEUDO-ATOMIC -- why? Is it to
;;; make sure that no GC happens between the time of allocation and the
;;; time that the allocated memory has its tag bits set correctly?
;;; If so, then ALLOCATION itself might as well set the PSEUDO-ATOMIC
;;; bits, so that the caller need only clear them. Check whether it's
;;; true that every ALLOCATION is surrounded by PSEUDO-ATOMIC, and
;;; that every PSEUDO-ATOMIC contains a single ALLOCATION, which is
;;; its first instruction. If so, the connection should probably be
;;; formalized, in documentation and in macro definition,
;;; with the macro becoming e.g. PSEUDO-ATOMIC-ALLOCATION.
