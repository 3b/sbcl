;;;; allocation helpers

;;; All allocation is done by calls to assembler routines that
;;; eventually invoke the C alloc() function.  Once upon a time
;;; (before threads) allocation within an alloc_region could also be
;;; done inline, with the aid of two C symbols storing the current
;;; allocation region boundaries; however, C cymbols are global.

;;; C calls for allocation don't /seem/ to make an awful lot of
;;; difference to speed.  Guessing from historical context, it looks
;;; like inline allocation was introduced before pseudo-atomic, at
;;; which time all calls to alloc() would have needed a syscall to
;;; mask signals for the duration.  Now we have pseudoatomic there's
;;; no need for that overhead.  Still, inline alloc would be a neat
;;; addition someday
