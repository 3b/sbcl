;;;; Save and restore dynamic environment.
;;;;
;;;; These VOPs are used in the reentered function to restore the
;;;; appropriate dynamic environment. Currently we only save the
;;;; Current-Catch and the alien stack pointer. (Before sbcl-0.7.0,
;;;; when there were IR1 and byte interpreters, we had to save
;;;; the interpreter "eval stack" too.)
;;;;
;;;; We don't need to save/restore the current UNWIND-PROTECT, since
;;;; UNWIND-PROTECTs are implicitly processed during unwinding.
;;;;
;;;; We don't need to save the BSP, because that is handled automatically.
