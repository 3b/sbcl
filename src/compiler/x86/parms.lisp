;;; ### Note: we simultaneously use ``word'' to mean a 32 bit quantity
;;; and a 16 bit quantity depending on context. This is because Intel
;;; insists on calling 16 bit things words and 32 bit things
;;; double-words (or dwords). Therefore, in the instruction definition
;;; and register specs, we use the Intel convention. But whenever we
;;; are talking about stuff the rest of the lisp system might be
;;; interested in, we use ``word'' to mean the size of a descriptor
;;; object, which is 32 bits.

;;;; description of the target address space

;;; where to put the different spaces
;;;
;;; Note: Mostly these values are black magic, inherited from CMU CL
;;; without any documentation. However, there were a few explanatory
;;; comments in the CMU CL sources:
;;;   * On Linux,
;;;     ** The space 0x08000000-0x10000000 is "C program and memory allocation".
;;;     ** The space 0x40000000-0x48000000 is reserved for shared libs.
;;;     ** The space >0xE0000000 is "C stack - Alien stack".
;;;   * On FreeBSD,
;;;     ** The space 0x0E000000-0x10000000 is "Foreign segment".
;;;     ** The space 0x20000000-0x30000000 is reserved for shared libs.
;;; And there have been some changes since the fork from CMU CL:
;;;   * The OpenBSD port is new since the fork. We started with
;;;     the FreeBSD address map, which actually worked until the
;;;     Alpha port patches, for reasons which in retrospect are rather
;;;     mysterious. After the Alpha port patches were added, the
;;;     OpenBSD port suffered memory corruption problems. While
;;;     debugging those, it was discovered that src/runtime/trymap
;;;     failed for the control stack region #x40000000-#x47fff000.
;;;     After the control stack was moved upward out of this region
;;;     (stealing some bytes from dynamic space) the problems went
;;;     away.
;;;   * The FreeBSD STATIC-SPACE-START value was bumped up from
;;;     #x28000000 to #x30000000 when FreeBSD ld.so dynamic linking
;;;     support was added for FreeBSD ca. 20000910. This was to keep from
;;;     stomping on an address range that the dynamic libraries want to
;;;     use. (They want to use this address range even if we try to
;;;     reserve it with a call to validate() as the first operation in
;;;     main().)
