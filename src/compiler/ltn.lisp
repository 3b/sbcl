;;; Return the LTN-POLICY indicated by the node policy.
;;;
;;; FIXME: It would be tidier to use an LTN-POLICY object (an instance
;;; of DEFSTRUCT LTN-POLICY) instead of a keyword, and have queries
;;; like LTN-POLICY-SAFE-P become slot accessors. If we do this,
;;; grep for and carefully review use of literal keywords, so that
;;; things like
;;;   (EQ (TEMPLATE-LTN-POLICY TEMPLATE) :SAFE)
;;; don't get overlooked.
;;;
;;; FIXME: Classic CMU CL went to some trouble to cache LTN-POLICY
;;; values in LTN-ANALYZE so that they didn't have to be recomputed on
;;; every block. I stripped that out (the whole DEFMACRO FROB thing)
;;; because I found it too confusing. Thus, it might be that the 
;;; new uncached code spends an unreasonable amount of time in
;;; this lookup function. This function should be profiled, and if
;;; it's a significant contributor to runtime, we can cache it in
;;; some more local way, e.g. by adding a CACHED-LTN-POLICY slot to
;;; the NODE structure, and doing something like
;;;   (DEFUN NODE-LTN-POLICY (NODE)
;;;     (OR (NODE-CACHED-LTN-POLICY NODE)
