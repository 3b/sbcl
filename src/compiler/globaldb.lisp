;;;; This file provides a functional interface to global information
;;;; about named things in the system. Information is considered to be
;;;; global if it must persist between invocations of the compiler. The
;;;; use of a functional interface eliminates the need for the compiler
;;;; to worry about the actual representation. This is important, since
;;;; the information may well have several representations.
;;;;
;;;; The database contains arbitrary Lisp values, addressed by a
;;;; combination of Name, Class and Type. The Name is a EQUAL-thing
;;;; which is the name of the thing we are recording information
;;;; about. Class is the kind of object involved. Typical classes are
;;;; :FUNCTION, :VARIABLE, :TYPE, ... A Type names a particular piece
;;;; of information within a given class. Class and Type are keywords,
;;;; and are compared with EQ.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.

;;; This is sorta semantically equivalent to SXHASH, but optimized for
;;; legal function names. Note: semantically equivalent does *not*
;;; mean that it always returns the same value as SXHASH, just that it
;;; satisfies the formal definition of SXHASH. The ``sorta'' is
;;; because SYMBOL-HASH will not necessarily return the same value in
;;; different lisp images.
;;;
;;; Why optimize? We want to avoid the fully-general TYPECASE in ordinary
;;; SXHASH, because
;;;   1. This hash function has to run when we're initializing the globaldb,
;;;      so it has to run before the type system is initialized, and it's
;;;      easier to make it do this if we don't try to do a general TYPECASE.
;;;   2. This function is in a potential bottleneck for the compiler,
;;;      and avoiding the general TYPECASE lets us improve performance
;;;      because
;;;	2a. the general TYPECASE is intrinsically slow, and
;;;	2b. the general TYPECASE is too big for us to easily afford
;;;	    to inline it, so it brings with it a full function call.
;;;
;;; Why not specialize instead of optimize? (I.e. why fall through to
;;; general SXHASH as a last resort?) Because the INFO database is used
;;; to hold all manner of things, e.g. (INFO :TYPE :BUILTIN ..)
;;; which is called on values like (UNSIGNED-BYTE 29). Falling through
;;; to SXHASH lets us support all manner of things (as long as they
;;; aren't used too early in cold boot for SXHASH to run).
