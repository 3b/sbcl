;;; ### Note: we simultaneously use ``word'' to mean a 32 bit quantity
;;; and a 16 bit quantity depending on context. This is because Intel
;;; insists on calling 16 bit things words and 32 bit things
;;; double-words (or dwords). Therefore, in the instruction definition
;;; and register specs, we use the Intel convention. But whenever we
;;; are talking about stuff the rest of the lisp system might be
;;; interested in, we use ``word'' to mean the size of a descriptor
;;; object, which is 32 bits.
