  ;; an alist translating variable names to LEAF structures. A special
  ;; binding is indicated by a :SPECIAL GLOBAL-VAR leaf. Each special
  ;; binding within the code gets a distinct leaf structure, as does
  ;; the current "global" value on entry to the code compiled.
  ;; (locally (special ...)) is handled by adding the most recent
  ;; special binding to the front of the list.

  ;; If the CDR is (MACRO . <exp>), then <exp> is the expansion of a
  ;; symbol macro.

  ;; "pervasive" type declarations. When THING is a leaf, this is for
  ;; type declarations that pertain to the type in a syntactic extent
  ;; which does not correspond to a binding of the affected name. When
  ;; THING is a continuation, this is used to track the innermost THE
  ;; type declaration.
