;;; FIXME: It's clever using :SUFFIX -TYPE for these things, but it's
;;; a pain for people just learning to find their way around the code
;;; who want to use lexical search to figure out where things like
;;; EVEN-FIXNUM-LOWTAG are defined. Remove the :SUFFIXes and just expand
;;; out the full names. Or even define them in DEF EVEN-FIXNUM-LOWTAG
;;; style so searches like 'def.*even-fixnum-lowtag' can find them.

;;; Tags for the main low-level types are stored in the low three
;;; bits to identify the type of a machine word.  Certain constraints 
;;; apply:
;;;   * EVEN-FIXNUM-LOWTAG and ODD-FIXNUM-LOWTAG must be 0 and 4: code
;;;     which shifts left two places to convert raw integers to tagged
;;;     fixnums is ubiquitous.
;;;   * LIST-POINTER-LOWTAG + 4 = OTHER-POINTER-LOWTAG: NIL is both a
;;;     cons and a symbol (at the same address) and depends on this.
;;;     See the definition of SYMBOL in objdef.lisp
;;;   * OTHER-POINTER-LOWTAG > 4: Some code in the SPARC backend,
;;;     which uses bit 2 of the ALLOC register to indicate that
;;;     PSEUDO-ATOMIC is on, doesn't strip the low bits of reg_ALLOC
;;;     before ORing in OTHER-POINTER-LOWTAG within a PSEUDO-ATOMIC
;;;     section.
;;; (These are just the ones we know about as of sbcl-0.7.1.22. There
;;; might easily be more, since these values have stayed highly
;;; constrained for more than a decade, an inviting target for
;;; inventive abstraction-phobic maintainers.:-)
