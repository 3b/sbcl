;;;
;;; We force a check to be hairy even when there are fixed values if
;;; we are in a context where we may be forced to use the unknown
;;; values convention anyway. This is because IR2tran can't generate
;;; type checks for unknown values continuations but people could
;;; still be depending on the check being done. We only care about
;;; EXIT and RETURN (not MV-COMBINATION) since these are the only
;;; contexts where the ultimate values receiver

;;; If true, the NOT-P flag indicates a test that the corresponding
;;; value is *not* of the specified TYPE. ORIGINAL-TYPE is the type
;;; asserted on this value in the continuation, for use in error
;;; messages. When NOT-P is true, this will be different from TYPE.
;;;
;;; This allows us to take what has been proven about CONT's type into
;;; consideration. If it is cheaper to test for the difference between
;;; the derived type and the asserted type, then we check for the
;;; negation of this type instead.

;;; Loop over all blocks in COMPONENT that have TYPE-CHECK set,
;;; looking for continuations with TYPE-CHECK T. We do two mostly
;;; unrelated things: detect compile-time type errors and determine if
;;; and how to do run-time type checks.
;;;
;;; If there is a compile-time type error, then we mark the
;;; continuation and emit a warning if appropriate. This part loops
;;; over all the uses of the continuation, since after we convert the
;;; check, the :DELETED kind will inhibit warnings about the types of
;;; other uses.
;;;
;;; If a continuation is too complex to be checked by the back end, or
;;; is better checked with explicit code, then convert to an explicit
;;; test. Assertions that can checked by the back end are passed
;;; through. Assertions that can't be tested are flamed about and
;;; marked as not needing to be checked.
;;;
;;; If we determine that a type check won't be done, then we set
;;; TYPE-CHECK to :NO-CHECK. In the non-hairy cases, this is just to
;;; prevent us from wasting time coming to the same conclusion again
;;; on a later iteration. In the hairy case, we must indicate to LTN
;;; that it must choose a safe implementation, since IR2 conversion
;;; will choke on the check.
;;;
;;; The generation of the type checks is delayed until all the type
;;; check decisions have been made because the generation of the type
;;; checks creates new nodes whose derived types aren't always updated
;;; which may lead to inappropriate template choices due to the
;;; modification of argument types.
