;;; CMU CL (as of 2.4.6 for Debian, anyway) issues warnings (and not
;;; just STYLE-WARNINGs, either, alas) when it tries to interpret code
;;; containing references to undefined functions. The most common
;;; problem is that macroexpanded code refers to this function, which
;;; isn't defined until late.
;;;
;;; This
;;;   #+cmu (defun sb!kernel::arg-count-error (&rest rest)
;;;	      (error "stub version of ARG-COUNT-ERROR, rest=~S" rest))
;;; doesn't work, with or without this
;;;   (compile 'sb!kernel::arg-count-error))
;;; so perhaps I should try
;;;   (declaim (ftype ..) ..)
;;; instead?
