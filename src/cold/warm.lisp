;;;; package hacking

;;; Our cross-compilation host is out of the picture now, so we no
;;; longer need to worry about collisions between our package names
;;; and cross-compilation host package names, so now is a good time to
;;; rename any package with a bootstrap-only name SB!FOO to its
;;; permanent name SB-FOO.
;;;
;;; (In principle it might be tidier to do this when dumping the cold
;;; image in genesis, but in practice the logic might be a little
;;; messier because genesis dumps both symbols and packages, and we'd
;;; need to make sure that dumped symbols were renamed in the same way
;;; as dumped packages. Or we could do it in cold init, but it's
;;; easier to experiment with and debug things here in warm init than
;;; in cold init, so we do it here instead.)

;;;; compiling and loading more of the system

;;;					     #-(or high-security small) 2

;;;			   (inhibit-warnings 2))

;;; FIXME: This has mutated into a hack which crudely duplicates
;;; functionality from the existing mechanism to load files from
;;; build-order.lisp-expr, without being quite parallel. (E.g. object
;;; files end up alongside the source files instead of ending up in
;;; parallel directory trees.) Maybe we could merge the filenames here
;;; into build-order.lisp-expr with some new flag (perhaps :WARM) to
;;; indicate that the files should be handled not in cold load but
;;; afterwards.

;;; While we were running on the cross-compilation host, we tried to
;;; be portable and not overwrite the doc strings for the standard
;;; packages. But now the cross-compilation host is only a receding
;;; memory, and we can have our way with the doc strings.
