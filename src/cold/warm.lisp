;;;; package hacking

;;; Our cross-compilation host is out of the picture now, so we no
;;; longer need to worry about collisions between our package names
;;; and cross-compilation host package names, so now is a good time to
;;; rename any package with a bootstrap-only name SB!FOO to its
;;; permanent name SB-FOO.
;;;
;;; (In principle it might be tidier to do this when dumping the cold
;;; image in genesis, but in practice the logic might be a little
;;; messier because genesis dumps both symbols and packages, and we'd
;;; need to make sure that dumped symbols were renamed in the same way
;;; as dumped packages. Or we could do it in cold init, but it's
;;; easier to experiment with and debug things here in warm init than
;;; in cold init, so we do it here instead.)

;;;; compiling and loading more of the system

;;; KLUDGE: In SBCL, almost all in-the-flow-of-control package hacking has
;;; gone away in favor of package setup controlled by tables. However, that
;;; mechanism isn't smart enough to handle shadowing, and since this shadowing
;;; is inherently a non-ANSI KLUDGE anyway (i.e. there ought to be no
;;; difference between e.g. CL:CLASS and SB-PCL:CLASS) there's not much
;;; point in trying to polish it by implementing a non-KLUDGEy way of
;;; setting it up. -- WHN 19991203

  ;; Of the shadowing symbols above, these are external symbols in CMU CL ca.

;;; FIXME: This has mutated into a hack which crudely duplicates

;;; parallel directory trees.) Maybe we could merge the filenames here
;;; into build-order.lisp-expr with some new flag (perhaps :WARM) to
;;; indicate that the files should be handled not in cold load but
