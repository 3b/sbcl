;;; Ye olde CMUCL comment follows, but it seems likely that the paper
;;; that would be inserted would resemble Kiczales and Rodruigez,
;;; Efficient Method Dispatch in PCL, ACM 1990.  Some of the details
;;; changed between that paper and "May Day PCL" of 1992; some other
;;; details have changed since, but reading that paper gives the broad
;;; idea.
;;;
;;; The caching algorithm implemented:
;;;
;;; << put a paper here >>
;;;
;;; For now, understand that as far as most of this code goes, a cache
;;; has two important properties. The first is the number of wrappers
;;; used as keys in each cache line. Throughout this code, this value
;;; is always called NKEYS. The second is whether or not the cache
;;; lines of a cache store a value. Throughout this code, this always
;;; called VALUEP.
;;;
;;; Depending on these values, there are three kinds of caches.
;;;
;;; NKEYS = 1, VALUEP = NIL
;;;
;;; In this kind of cache, each line is 1 word long. No cache locking
;;; is needed since all read's in the cache are a single value.
;;; Nevertheless line 0 (location 0) is reserved, to ensure that
;;; invalid wrappers will not get a first probe hit.
;;;
;;; To keep the code simpler, a cache lock count does appear in
;;; location 0 of these caches, that count is incremented whenever
;;; data is written to the cache. But, the actual lookup code (see
;;; make-dlap) doesn't need to do locking when reading the cache.
;;;
;;; NKEYS = 1, VALUEP = T
;;;
;;; In this kind of cache, each line is 2 words long. Cache locking
;;; must be done to ensure the synchronization of cache reads. Line 0
;;; of the cache (location 0) is reserved for the cache lock count.
;;; Location 1 of the cache is unused (in effect wasted).
;;;
;;; NKEYS > 1
;;;
;;; In this kind of cache, the 0 word of the cache holds the lock
;;; count. The 1 word of the cache is line 0. Line 0 of these caches
;;; is not reserved.
;;;
;;; This is done because in this sort of cache, the overhead of doing
;;; the cache probe is high enough that the 1+ required to offset the
;;; location is not a significant cost. In addition, because of the
;;; larger line sizes, the space that would be wasted by reserving
;;; line 0 to hold the lock count is more significant.

;;; caches
;;;
;;; A cache is essentially just a vector. The use of the individual
;;; `words' in the vector depends on particular properties of the
;;; cache as described above.
;;;
;;; This defines an abstraction for caches in terms of their most
;;; obvious implementation as simple vectors. But, please notice that
;;; part of the implementation of this abstraction, is the function
;;; lap-out-cache-ref. This means that most port-specific
;;; modifications to the implementation of caches will require
;;; corresponding port-specific modifications to the lap code
;;; assembler.

;;;; wrapper cache numbers

;;; non-zero bits wrapper cache numbers will have.
;;;
;;; The value of this constant is the number of wrapper cache numbers
;;; which can be added and still be certain the result will be a
;;; fixnum. This is used by all the code that computes primary cache
;;; locations from multiple wrappers.

;;; are the forms of this constant which it is more convenient for the
;;; runtime code to use.

;;;; wrappers themselves

;;; This caching algorithm requires that wrappers have more than one
;;; wrapper cache number. You should think of these multiple numbers
;;; as being in columns. That is, for a given cache, the same column
;;; of wrapper cache numbers will be used.
;;;
;;; If at some point the cache distribution of a cache gets bad, the
;;; cache can be rehashed by switching to a different column.
;;;
;;; The columns are referred to by field number which is that number
;;; which, when used as a second argument to wrapper-ref, will return
;;; that column of wrapper cache number.
;;;
;;; This code is written to allow flexibility as to how many wrapper
;;; cache numbers will be in each wrapper, and where they will be
;;; located. It is also set up to allow port specific modifications to
;;; `pack' the wrapper cache numbers on machines where the addressing
;;; modes make that a good idea.

;;; In SBCL, as in CMU CL, we want to do type checking as early as
;;; possible; structures help this. The structures are hard-wired to
;;; have a fixed number of cache hash values, and that number must
;;; correspond to the number of cache lines we use.
