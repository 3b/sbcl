;;;; DEFCLASS macro and close personal friends

;;; ANSI says (Macro DEFCLASS, section 7.7) that DEFCLASS, if it
;;; "appears as a top level form, the compiler must make the class
;;; name be recognized as a valid type name in subsequent declarations
;;; (as for deftype) and be recognized as a valid class name for
;;; defmethod parameter specializers and for use as the :metaclass
;;; option of a subsequent defclass."
(defun preinform-compiler-about-class-type (name)
  ;; Unless the type system already has an actual type attached to
  ;; NAME (in which case (1) writing a placeholder value over that
  ;; actual type as a compile-time side-effect would probably be a bad
  ;; idea and (2) anyway we don't need to modify it in order to make
  ;; NAME be recognized as a valid type name)
  (unless (info :type :kind name)

;;; After the metabraid has been setup, and the protocol for defining
;;; classes has been defined, the real definition of LOAD-DEFCLASS is
