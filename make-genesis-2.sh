# In a fresh host Lisp invocation, load the cross-compiler (in order
# to get various definitions that GENESIS needs, not in order to
# cross-compile GENESIS, then load and run GENESIS. (We use a fresh
# host Lisp invocation here for basically the same reasons we did
# before when loading and running the cross-compiler.)
#
# (Why do we need this second invocation of GENESIS? In order to
# create a .core file, as opposed to just a .h file, GENESIS needs
# symbol table data on the C runtime. And we can get that symbol
# data only after the C runtime has been built. Therefore, even
# though we ran GENESIS earlier, we couldn't get it to make a .core
# file at that time; but we needed to run it earlier in order to 
# get to where we can write a .core file.)
