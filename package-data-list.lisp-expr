;;;; which are handled elsewhere by other mechanisms:
;;;;   * the creation of the trivial SB-SLOT-ACCESSOR-NAME package
;;;;   * any SHADOWing hackery
;;;;   * the standard, non-SBCL-specific packages COMMON-LISP,
;;;;     COMMON-LISP-USER, and KEYWORD

;;;; The packages are named SB!FOO here and elsewhere in
